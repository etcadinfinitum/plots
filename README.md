Climbing Plot

To compile and run the graph and receive expected output, use the following Python modules and indicated versions:

* python: **3.6.5**
* numpy: **1.14.4**
* matplotlib: **2.2.2**

Newer versions were used due to supporting dictionary operations in order of declaration. Note: probably not the best  workaround, but oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
